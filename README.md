# Multi-Monitor-Mouse-Teleporter
## A Computer Vision Project
### Pose Tracking Multi Monitor Mouse Teleporter
This program tracks your head movement and can move the mouse to either monitors as you turn your gaze.

## Setup Process
1) Make sure you have pip installed on your system
2) Run the reqs.py file before running the MouseHead.py
3) Run MouseHead with the usual "python3 MouseHead.py" in your terminal

### Status:
Current version is only capable for monitors on the right, but the code can be modified quite easily for a monitor on the left, or more than 2 monitor setups.
Currently working on a GUI on the Qt Framework.
