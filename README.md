# Multi-Monitor-Mouse-Teleporter
Pose Tracking Multi Monitor Mouse Teleporter
A program which tracks your head movement and can move the mouse as soon as your look at your secondary or primary monitor.
Current version is only capable for monitors on the right, but the code can be modified quite easily for a monitor on the left, or < 2 monitor setups.
Currently working on a GUI on the Qt Framework.
