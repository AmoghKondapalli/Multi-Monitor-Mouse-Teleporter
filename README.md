# Multi-Monitor-Mouse-Teleporter
## A Computer Vision Project
Pose Tracking Multi Monitor Mouse Teleporter
A program which tracks your head movement and can move the mouse as soon as your look at your secondary or primary monitor.
Current version is only capable for monitors on the right, but the code can be modified quite easily for a monitor on the left, or more than 2 monitor setups.
Currently working on a GUI on the Qt Framework.

## Setup Process
1) Make sure you have pip installed on your system
2) Run the reqs.py file before running the MouseHead.py
3) Run MouseHead with the usual "python3 MouseHead.py" in your terminal
